Portfolio

Hello! This is the ReadMe for Homework #2.

For this homework I was tasked with creating a professional portfolio. I have done so using HTML and CSS to the best of my ability. While this project falls short of my expectation of myself I am proud of what I have so far. I'm looking forward to adding on to this project and molding it into what I know it can be.

What was your motivation?

My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio that I can add to as I progess as a programmer. I tried to think of it as a living documentation of my progess. 

Why did you build this project?

I built this with the intent of eventually becoming a launch pad for my future as a coder.

What problem does it solve?

The problem this project will allow me to show my work or progression to any potential employers

What did you learn?

I learned that I still have much to learn as I begin my journey.
